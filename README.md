## 📘 Project Title
**AI-Based Early Dropout Risk Prediction System**

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
Educational institutions lack data-driven mechanisms to identify students at risk of dropping out at an early stage. Existing approaches rely on manual monitoring or post-failure indicators, which are reactive, non-scalable, and ineffective for timely intervention.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
This project proposes an AI-driven predictive system that analyzes student engagement, academic performance, and behavioral indicators to estimate dropout risk. A supervised machine learning model is trained on historical student data to classify students into risk categories, enabling proactive intervention by educators.

---

## 🧠 System Architecture & Workflow
1. Data collection from academic and engagement sources  
2. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
3. Model training and validation  
4. Dropout risk prediction  
5. Insight visualization via dashboards
